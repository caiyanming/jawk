/**
 * A pointer to a tuple within the list of tuples.
 * Addresses are used for jumps, especially in reaction to
 * conditional checks (i.e., if false, jump to else block, etc.).
 * <p>
 * Addresses have the following properties:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A name (label).
 * <li>An index into the tuple queue.
 * </ul>
 * An address may not necessarily have an index assigned upon creation.
 * However, upon tuple traversal, all address indexes must
 * point to a valid tuple.
 * <p>
 * All addresses should have a meaningful label.
