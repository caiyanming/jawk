Jawk is a pure Java implementation of [AWK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK). It executes the specified AWK scripts to parse and process text input, and generate a text output. Jawk can be used as a CLI, but more importantly it can be invoked from within your Java project.

This project is forked from the excellent [Jawk project](https://jawk.sourceforge.net/) that was maintained by [hoijui on GitHub](https://github.com/hoijui/Jawk).

## Run Jawk CLI

See [Jawk CLI documentation](https://metricshub.org/Jawk/cli.html)

## Run AWK inside Java

Execute a script in just one line using the convenience methods on `Awk`:

```java
String result = Awk.run("{ print toupper($0) }", "hello world");
```

See [AWK in Java documentation](https://metricshub.org/Jawk/java.html) for more details and advanced usage.
