Jawk is a pure Java implementation of [AWK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK). It executes the specified AWK scripts to parse and process text input, and generate a text output. Jawk can be used as a CLI, but more importantly it can be invoked from within your Java project.

This project is forked from the excellent [Jawk project](https://jawk.sourceforge.net/) that was maintained by [hoijui on GitHub](https://github.com/hoijui/Jawk).

Jawk does not rely on any logging framework; errors are reported through standard Java exceptions.

## Run Jawk CLI

See [Jawk CLI documentation](https://metricshub.org/Jawk/cli.html)
for command-line options, including `-K <filename>` to compile a script
to a tuples file and `-L <filename>` to load previously compiled tuples.
Use `--list-ext` to display available extensions (with their human readable
names) and `-l <extension>` or `--load <extension>` to load them by extension
name, simple class name, or fully qualified class name.

Enable sandbox mode with `-S` or `--sandbox` to disable the `system()`
function, all input/output redirection, command pipelines, and loading
dynamic extensions during script execution.

When embedding Jawk, instantiate `SandboxedAwk` to apply the same sandbox
restrictions programmatically.

## Run AWK inside Java

Execute a script in just one line using the convenience methods on `Awk`:

```java
Awk awk = new Awk();
String result = awk.run("{ print toupper($0) }", "hello world");
```

See [AWK in Java documentation](https://metricshub.org/Jawk/java.html) for more details and advanced usage.

## Writing tests with `AwkTestSupport`

Jawk ships with the `org.metricshub.jawk.AwkTestSupport` utility to make unit
tests expressive and repeatable. The helper provides fluent builders for both
`Awk` and CLI driven tests, letting you define scripts, inputs, operands,
pre-assigned variables, expected outputs, and even required operating-system
capabilities in a single, readable block. Each builder automatically creates a
temporary execution environment, resolves placeholder paths inside scripts and
input data, executes the script, and performs assertions on the captured
results. The helper also exposes assertions such as `runAndAssert()` and
`assertExpected()` so the intent of the test remains clear.

### Example: testing the Java API

```java
import static org.metricshub.jawk.AwkTestSupport.awkTest;

@Test
public void uppercasesAllInput() throws Exception {
        awkTest("uppercase conversion")
                .script("{ print toupper($0) }")
                .input("hello", "world")
                .expectedOutput("HELLO\nWORLD\n")
                .runAndAssert();
}
```

### Example: testing the CLI entry point

```java
import static org.metricshub.jawk.AwkTestSupport.cliTest;

@Test
public void reportsUsageOnMissingScript() throws Exception {
        cliTest("missing script argument")
                .args("-f")
                .expectedExitCode(2)
                .expectedOutput("usage: jawk ...\n")
                .runAndAssert();
}
```

Always lean on `AwkTestSupport` when adding new tests. Jawk spans a broad
surface area—parsing, evaluation, file-system interaction, and extension
loading—which makes correctness regressions easy to introduce. Consistently
exercising features with unit tests gives us quick feedback when refactoring,
ensures behaviour remains consistent across supported platforms, and protects
our compatibility guarantees with the wider AWK ecosystem. By funneling all
tests through the shared helper we avoid duplicated boilerplate and ensure that
every test follows the same execution semantics, leaving more time to reason
about the scenarios being validated instead of the mechanics of running them.
